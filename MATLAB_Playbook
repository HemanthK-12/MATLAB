if you don't assign a variable to a value, it will be stored in the ans variable by default

a=[3 10 5] #Row Vector
O/P: a= 3  10  5

b=[6;8;4] #Column Vector
b= 6
   8
   4

c=[5 6 7;8 9 10]  #Matrix
5	6	7
8	9	10

d=1:5#makes a row vector from 1 to 5
d= 1  2  3  4  5

z=1:0.5:5 #makes a row vector from 1 to 5 with increment of 0.5
z= 1.0000  1.5000  2.0000  2.5000  3.0000  3.5000  4.0000  4.5000  5.0000

e=linspace(a,b,c) #makes a row vector from a to b with c elements

f=f' #trasposes f

x=rand(n) #makes a n*n matrix with random values between 0 and 1

y=rand(m,n) #makes a m*n matrix with random values between 0 and 1

x=data(6,3) #extracts value in 6th row and 3rd column
x=data(6,:) #extracts all values in 6th row

#Use the "end" keyword to extract the last element of a vector or matrix

If we use data(8),it goes through the first column,then the 2nd column then the 3rd and so on until it counts 8 places and returns the 8th element.


hiel=density([1 3 6]) #returns the 1st,3rd and 6th element of the vector

vm=max(va) #To find the max vale in a vector va

c=a*b # performs matrix multiplication
c=a.*b #performs element-wise multiplication(corresponding elements)

[rows,column]=size(data) #returns the number of rows and columns in the matrix data
[~,column]=size(v2)#The ~ symbol tells MATLAB to ignore that output argument

PLOTTING

plot(x,y) #plots a graph with x as x-axis and y as y-axis
plot(sample,mass2,"r*") #plots a graph with sample as x-axis and mass2 as y-axis with red stars as markers

hold on #holds the current plot and allows you to add multiple plots to the same figure
hold off #releases the current plot

title("Sample Mass") #to add a title to the plot
ylabel("Mass (g)") # to add a label to the y-axis
legend("Exp A","Exp B") # to add a legend to the plot
